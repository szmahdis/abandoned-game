**Abandoned**

This game was created as part of a university project.

_About the game:_

The players find themselves in an abandoned hospital. They realize this, by exploring the area around them and interacting with the objects surrounding them. The focus of this game is on the atmosphere and audio. With the ambient music playing in the background, the heartbeat, and breathing sounds, a spooky and mysterious environment is created. The goal of the game is to solve the puzzles such as find the keys in each level and abandon the hospital.

_Implementation Details:_

For our advanced audio patterns we focused on the "Real-Time Parameter Controls", "Sequencing", "Variation and Randomization" and "States". 

We implemented the "Real-Time Parameter Controls" in our Geiger-counter that changes the volume and the pitch of the emitting sounds. We cast a ray from our Geiger counter that can calculate the distance from the Player to the ghost and calculates with it the volume and the pitch of our sound effects. 

"Sequencing" was implemented very often around our levels while interacting with the environment. We placed notes around our levels when the player looks at one of them a new window will open and a sound is played when the time ends the window will close and another sound is played to give the player an audio cue that they can continue.

For the "Variation and Randomization" we used normal C# arrays with different sounds for our steps. We iterate randomly through them but never repeat the same sound in a row to resemble walk in real life. 

The last pattern was implemented with a texture scanner that looks the terrain texture number up and changes the used array with the different footstep sounds. For our walk in the graveyard for example the ground scanner got the number one and changed the array to the steps on the grass. We also change in a cave entrance to another part of the hospital the sounds of our steps to a more echo-like sound.
